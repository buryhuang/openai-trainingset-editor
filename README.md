# OpenAI Fine-tune Training Set Editor

A free, open-source web-based editor for OpenAI fine-tuning JSONL files. This tool allows you to easily view, edit, and validate your training data for OpenAI fine-tuning tasks.

For more information about OpenAI's fine-tuning feature, see the [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning).

## Motivation

While working with OpenAI's fine-tuning feature, I noticed a lack of user-friendly tools for editing JSONL training sets. Most solutions involved manual text editing or writing custom scripts. This project aims to fill that gap by providing a simple, intuitive interface for managing fine-tuning datasets.

## Features

- üìù Visual editing of JSONL files with role-based message formatting
- üîç Preview conversation flow with system/user/assistant messages
- ‚ú® Clean interface with syntax highlighting
- üíæ Local file processing (no data sent to any servers)
- ‚ö° Real-time validation and error checking
- üì• Easy import/export of JSONL files

## Usage

1. Visit the editor (hosted version coming soon)
2. Upload your JSONL file
3. Edit messages using the visual interface
4. Download the modified JSONL file

## Privacy & Security

This tool runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent to any external servers, making it safe for processing sensitive training data.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```
