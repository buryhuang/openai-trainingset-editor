                  I created this editor because I couldn't find a simple tool for editing OpenAI fine-tuning datasets. 
                  The video above from Corbin Brown shows what fine-tuning is about - that's exactly what this tool helps you prepare for. 
                  It's completely free to use and runs entirely in your browser. 
                  With enough support, I'd love to add real-time validation and more advanced features to make your workflow even smoother!

                  Here's something cool: I didn't write a single line of code for this tool! The entire project was created through AI pair programming.
                  It started as a sketch using v0 by Vercel, then moved to GitHub where Cursor (an AI-powered IDE) helped build everything you see here.
                  The initial version, from idea to public deployment, took just 2 hours of my time.
                  This rapid development showcases how AI tools can help turn ideas into reality incredibly fast - 
                  from ideation to deployment on Vercel, all through natural conversations with AI.
                  This project is a testament to how AI can help create useful tools for the AI community.

                  <p>
                    A JSONL (JSON Lines) file is a convenient format for storing structured data where each line is a valid JSON object.
                    In the context of AI training, each line represents a single training example, making it perfect for handling large datasets
                    without loading everything into memory at once.

                  <p>
                    OpenAI's fine-tuning process uses JSONL files as the standard format for training data. Each line contains a conversation
                    with messages from different roles (system, user, assistant), allowing you to teach the AI specific patterns, styles, or
                    domain knowledge. This format ensures that the AI model can clearly understand the role and context of each message in the
                    conversation.

                  <p>
                    Human evaluation and editing of training data is crucial for developing reliable AI agents. By carefully reviewing and
                    editing JSONL files, we can:

                    <li>Maintain consistency in the AI's responses</li>

                  <p>
                    The path to creating autonomous and intelligent AI agents heavily relies on the quality of their training data.
                    By providing well-structured, carefully curated examples through JSONL files, we can guide AI models to better
                    understand context, maintain consistency, and provide more helpful responses. This human-in-the-loop approach
                    to AI training ensures that models remain aligned with human values and expectations while continuously improving
                    their capabilities.
